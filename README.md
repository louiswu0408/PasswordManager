# Password Manager (PowerShell)

A simple and secure password manager implemented in PowerShell.  
Stores encrypted passwords locally and allows adding, retrieving, listing, and deleting accounts with a master password.

---

## Motivation

I have many game accounts and used to save them all in a Google Doc, but constantly copying and pasting was annoying. This tool makes managing and accessing accounts faster, easier, and more secure. It also protects privacy when sharing a PC, so each user’s passwords remain encrypted and separate.

## Features

- Store multiple accounts with username and password.
- Encrypt passwords using AES-256 with a unique salt and IV per entry.
- Derive encryption key from your master password using PBKDF2 (Rfc2898DeriveBytes).
- Auto-copy feature: usernames are copied immediately, and passwords are copied automatically when you paste (Ctrl+V), keeping sensitive data secure.
- Avoid duplicate accounts with the same username and password.
- Vault data is saved in a JSON file, sorted by site and username.
